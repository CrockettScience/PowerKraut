# PowerKraut
A 2D renderer Built with C#, C++, Vulkan.

My original goal was to build a game engine that used a lower level API than OpenGL for educational purposes. Years later, I'm repurposing it as a robust shader viewer, with a GUI that allows dynamic creation of shader parameters and secondary inputs, that can interface with Streamlabs OBS as an input source.

The renderer is built in C++, and interfaces directly with the Vulkan library. The frontend application is built in C#.
